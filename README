# FFIEC ETL System

This is a system for extracting call reports from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's
Central Data Repository. The data is loaded into hbase and designed to hopefully facilitate analysis. 

The ETL process is executed in a docker container, a running container can be thought of as a 'job'. 
Each instance of the software is intended to collect the data from a single institution. The
idea is that many jobs can be executed simultaniously on a container scheduling system. When running
a job, specify the institution you'd like data on by passing a valid [rssd identifier](https://www.alacra.com/alacra/outside/lei/info/rssdid.html).

If you're feeling patient, you can pass a wildcard splat ```*```.
